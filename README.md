The implimentation of the EC2 remediation system using an AI agent is massively beneficial. The AI agent requires a different set of skills to setup but unltimately can be done much quickers given the right experience. The down side of the AI agent is that it requires the manual remediation system to already be in place, but once it is the AI agent is able to mostly automate and simply the remediation process. The manual remediation proccess requires a button to be clicked on the EC2 incident in the EC2 instance table, this will send a notitication to the given slack channel with an acompanied Knowledge Base article that is related to the given problem. This will allow the DevOps team the resources the need in order to fix the problem. Howvever, the AI agent allows for the incident to be taken care of almostly entirely by the agent. The agent does need confirmation from a DevOps team member before it does anything, however it can and will fix the problem faster and with less human input.
